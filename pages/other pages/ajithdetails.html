                    <h1>Film career</h1>

                    <p>1984 - 2003: Child actor and transition into lead roles

                        Vijay in 1987
                        At the age of 10, Vijay started his film career as a child actor in Vetri (1984), making his first paycheck of ₹500 rupees paid for by actor-and-producer P. S. Veerappa.[21] He then performed as a child actor in films such as Kudumbam (1984), Vasantha Raagam (1986), Sattam Oru Vilayaattu (1987) and Ithu Engal Neethi (1988). He also performed in Naan Sigappu Manithan (1985) as a co-star to Rajinikanth, who was the lead actor.
                        
                        Vijay started to play lead roles at the age of 18 starting with Naalaiya Theerpu (1992).[22] Vijay then appeared in the films Sendhoorapandi, Rasigan, Deva and Coimbatore Mappillai. They were commercially successful, though not critically acclaimed.[23][24][25]
                     
                        In 1996, Vijay performed in the Vikraman-directed Poove Unakkaga, which he states gave him his "initial breaks" and caused his popularity to "reach great heights".[26] In 1997, Vijay acted in Kaalamellam Kaathiruppen which received positive response from critics,[27] and Love Today, which was applauded by audiences.[28]

He also starred in the films Nerrukku Ner, Kadhalukku Mariyadhai, Ninaithen Vandhai, Priyamudan and Thulladha Manamum Thullum which released to positive reviews and were commercially successful.[29][30] He then performed in Nilaave Vaa. This was followed by the films Endrendrum Kadhal, Nenjinile, and Minsara Kanna.[31]

In 2000, he performed in Kannukkul Nilavu, which was Vijay's 25th critically successful film,[32] alongside two commercially successful romance films, Kushi and Priyamaanavale. His next successful films were Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. In 2002, he starred in the action film Thamizhan alongside Hindi actress Priyanka Chopra.[33][28] Later, he featured in the romantic film Youth and the action film Bagavathi.[34]

                    <h1>2003 - 2011: Star status in Tamil cinema</h1>

                    <p>Following the action-romance flick Thirumalai in 2003, Ghilli, a film directed by S. Dharani and produced by A. M. Rathnam, was released. It co-starred Trisha and Prakash Raj with Vijay as the lead.[36] Ghilli was the first Tamil film of all time to gross over ₹500 million, or ₹50 crore, in the domestic box office.[37] The film grossed nearly $500,000 in the Malaysian market.[38] Ghilli also broke the record for the most people seeing a movie in the first week of its release, previously held by M. G. Ramachandran's Adimai Penn (1969).[38] Ghilli received favourable reviews.[39] The Hindu stated that "Vijay, the hero whom the masses today identify with, and Prakash Raj, the inimitable villain in tow, this flick, "Ghilli"...on a winning track".[40]


                        Vijay at a function in 2007
                        Ghilli was followed by commercially successful films Madhurey and Thirupaachi in 2005.[41] Later, Vijay starred in the commercially and critically successful films Sachein, Sivakasi and Pokkiri.[41] Pokkiri was one of the highest-grossing films in his career at that time.[42]
                        
                        In late 2007, Vijay starred in the romantic thriller film Azhagiya Tamil Magan, where he played the role of the protagonist and antagonist at the same time.[43] Azhagiya Tamil Magan collected $1.043 million overseas, a top grosser at overseas box offices in 2007.[44] Screen Daily, a British magazine, reported that Azhagiya Tamil Magan had entered the top ten Asian films box office hit chart in Malaysia in 2007.[45] Barring the commercially successful Vettaikaaran (2009),[46] all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Tamil Magan, Kuruvi and Villu were average successes; all three films were more successful overseas.[47][48][49] In 2009, Vijay became one of the highest paid actors in South India.[50] In 2010, he acted in the action comedy film Sura, which was a box office failure.
                    
                        In early 2011, Vijay joined up with director Siddique for the romantic comedy Kaavalan. It received positive responses from both viewers and critics, with a box office collection of ₹102 crore worldwide.[53][54] Kaavalan was screened at the Shanghai International Film Festival in China.[55] Kaavalan was a commercial success in China.[56] During Diwali the same year, his next film, the action film Velayudham, directed by M. Raja and produced by Venu Ravichandran, was released.[37] Velayudham became one of the top-grossing films of 2011.[37] Velayudham was a critical success among Japanese audiences.</p>
