Gautami had announced on her blog that she had ended her relationship with him[4] writing, "It is heartbreaking for me to have to say today that I and Mr. Haasan are no longer together. After almost 13 years together, it has been one of the most devastating decisions that I have ever had to make in my life."[125]
                
                Early in his career, he co-starred in several films with Srividya. Haasan visited Srividya on her deathbed in 2006.</p>
